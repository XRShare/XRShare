1.  Identify the redundant asset catalog located at `/Users/alikara/Desktop/CPSC 599/XR-Anatomy-App-2 copy 2/Shared/Assets.xcassets`. This catalog duplicates assets like AppIcon, logo_white, and SharedAnchors which are correctly placed (or should be placed) within the target-specific asset catalogs (`XR Anatomy/Assets.xcassets` and `XR Anatomy Vision/Assets.xcassets`).
2.  Delete the entire `/Users/alikara/Desktop/CPSC 599/XR-Anatomy-App-2 copy 2/Shared/Assets.xcassets` directory and all its contents to eliminate redundancy and potential build conflicts. The necessary assets are already present in the respective target asset catalogs.

    <description>Delete the redundant Shared/Assets.xcassets directory and all its contents. Assets like AppIcon must reside in target-specific catalogs, and shared resources like ARAnchors are correctly placed in the visionOS target's assets (and should be added to iOS assets if needed there).</description>
